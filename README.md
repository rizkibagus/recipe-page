Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <section class="preparation-section">
            <h2>Preparation time</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Total</span>: Approximately 10 minutes</li>
              <li><span>Preparation</span>: 5 minutes</li>
              <li><span>Cooking</span>: 5 minutes</li>
              
            </ul>
  </section>
```
```css
    main .preparation-section {
    background-color: var(--rose50);
    padding: 2rem;
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    }

    .preparation-section h2 {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
    color: var(--brown800);
    font-weight: 600;
    margin-bottom:0.5rem;
    }

    .preparation-section ul {
    padding-left: 2rem;
    }

    .preparation-section ul li {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    color: var(--stone600);
    font-weight: 300;
    padding-left: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    }

    .preparation-section ul li span {
    font-weight: 600;
    }

    .preparation-section ul li::marker {
    color: var(--brown800);
    }
```
